Two directories defined depending on how the simple branching configuration is set up
- spatialNeuron_configuration
	--> Defind branching configuration using SpationNeuron() and morphology with Synapses() function and .connect to connect compartments
		( described in https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/multicompartmental.html )
	--> UNCLEAR how whether synaptic connections are defined appropriately
- neuronGroup_configuration
	--> Defined branching configuration using NeuronGroup() with Snapses() function and .connect() to connect compartments
	--> Morphological parameters still not incorporated
